# Nakshh's First CS193 Homework

#### My favorite things about CS193!
    - It is taught by undergraduates
    - Classes only once a week
    - The one class is very informational
    - PSO sessions will be very helpful when im confused
    - Only cool classes use Ed Discussion ðŸ˜Ž

#### Important notice to the person grading

##### The chosen theme look adds a # to the end of every title and to be honest it looks good. It was not a formatting issue I promise :)
